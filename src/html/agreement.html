The Company has the right to subcontract any of the Support Services to third parties without Customer&rsquo;s prior authorization. Support is delivered in English only, unless the Customer is in a location where localized support has been made available by the Company at the Company&rsquo;s discretion. Customer shall promptly notify the Company if such individuals are no longer designated as Technical Support Contacts. The Support Services are only applicable to the Products specifically associated with each level of the Support Program (the &ldquo;Supported Product&rdquo;) and to no other instances of products or services Customer may also be using.
